# Specs Workflow Configuration
# This file customizes the workflow for this project
# All fields are optional - remove sections you don't need

# Default schema to use for new changes
# Options: spec-driven, tdd (or custom schemas in schemas/)
schema: spec-driven

# Project context that applies to all artifacts
# This helps the AI understand your project better
context: |
  This is a [type of project] built with [tech stack].
  
  Key characteristics:
  - [Important detail 1]
  - [Important detail 2]
  
  Coding standards:
  - [Standard 1]
  - [Standard 2]

# Rules applied during artifact generation
# These guide the AI when creating specific artifact types
rules:
  # Rules for specifications
  specs:
    - Include error scenarios for all requirements
    - Use SHALL for requirements, SHOULD for recommendations
    - Every requirement MUST have at least one scenario
    - Include performance criteria where relevant
    - Document security implications
    
  # Rules for tasks
  tasks:
    - Break tasks into 15-60 minute chunks
    - Include verification steps for each task
    - Reference specific spec requirements
    - Add testing tasks for all implementation tasks
    - Include documentation updates where needed
    
  # Rules for design documents
  design:
    - Include ASCII diagrams for architecture
    - Document alternatives considered
    - Include rollback strategy
    - Reference existing patterns in the codebase
    - Document security considerations

# Default settings for workflow behavior
defaults:
  # Automatically archive changes when all tasks complete
  archiveOnComplete: true
  
  # Sync specs to main before archiving
  syncBeforeArchive: true
  
  # Create only one artifact per /specs-continue invocation
  createOnePerRun: true
  
  # Default naming convention
  naming:
    changeCase: kebab-case
    capabilityCase: kebab-case

# Custom templates (optional)
# Override default templates for specific artifact types
templates:
  # proposal: templates/custom-proposal.md
  # spec: templates/custom-spec.md
  # design: templates/custom-design.md
  # tasks: templates/custom-tasks.md

# Validation settings
validation:
  # Require all scenarios to use Given/When/Then format
  strictScenarioFormat: true
  
  # Require migration paths for removed requirements
  requireMigrationPaths: true
  
  # Maximum proposal length (in lines, 0 = no limit)
  maxProposalLines: 100
  
  # Minimum scenarios per requirement
  minScenariosPerRequirement: 1
